# Contributing to Escapin

We would love to have you contribute to Escapin!

## Contributing

1. Look through the existing issues and see if your idea is something new.
2. Create a new issue, or comment on an existing issue that you would like
   to help solve:
    * it's usually best to get some feedback before proceeding to write code.
3. fork the Escapin repo, and clone it to your computer:
    * GitHub has [great documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) regarding writing your first pull request.
4. make sure that you write unit-test for any code that you write for Escapin:
    * we use [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) for formatting source code;
      it will validate your style when you run tests.
    * look through our extensive test suite in `/test` to get an idea for how
      to write unit-tests for this codebase.
5. make sure you are comfortable with the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
